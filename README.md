## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate an understanding of JavaScript and React, focusing on optimization techniques to minimize unnecessary re-renders and enhance application performance.

## Overview
This React application displays a list of items and allows users to filter these items based on a search input. The application is built using best practices, including Redux Toolkit for state management, memoization, and React hooks.
